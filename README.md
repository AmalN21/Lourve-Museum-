1. **Artwork Management: **The system should maintain a comprehensive catalog of the museum's artworks, artifacts, and exhibitions. Each item in the collection should have detailed information such as title, artist, date of creation, historical significance, and exhibition location. The locations are of the following: permanent galleries, exhibition halls, and outdoor spaces.
2. **Visitor Management: **The system should facilitate the management of visitor information: ticket purchases and visitor demographics. Visitors can purchase tickets online or in-person for various exhibitions, tours, and special events that the museum offers. Exhibitions are held for a duration of time and in a particular location in the museum, which is mentioned on the purchased tickets. Tours are facilitated on a selected date for a group of 15 to 40 visitors with a guide, and the details are mentioned on the ticket. Special events are organized for purposes such as fundraising, musical concerts, or light shows, and the location and duration are mentioned on the tickets.
3. **Ticketing and Pricing: **The system should support flexible pricing options for different visitor categories. Adults between the ages of 18 to 60 pay 63 AED. Additionally, the system applies a 5% value-added tax (VAT) on the final ticket price. However, children below 18, teachers and students of an institute, and seniors (above 60) are given a free ticket upon presenting their national ID cards. Groups receive a 50% discount on the ticket's original price. Special Events have individual ticket prices
